## Overview
Echo is an innovative messaging app that lets you connect with strangers within a specific geo-radius, enabling time and location-relevant chats; ideal for environments like lecture halls, libraries, or public events. With real-time messaging that doesn‚Äôt store conversations on servers, Echo emulates the spontaneity of in-person conversations. This repository is open to community collaboration, and is divided into the frontend (React Native mobile app) and backend (Node.js server).

## Features
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Engage in instant conversations.
- **Geo-Based Chat:** Connect with people nearby for context-aware discussions.
- **Privacy-Focused:** Messages are transient, ensuring a private chat experience.
- **Community Driven:** Built as an open source project to welcome contributions from developers of all backgrounds.

## Installation
As of Spring 2025, Echo is still under development. If you're interested in exploring the codebase or contributing to the project, please refer to our detailed [documentation](https://osc-proximity-documentation.vercel.app/) for setup instructions, prerequisites, and environment configuration. Your support can help us accelerate the release!

## Contributing
We invite developers from all walks of life to help shape Echo. Whether you're into coding, debugging, or enhancing UI/UX design, there are plenty of ways to get involved.
