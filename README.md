Echo is a new messaging app aimed at allowing you to talk to strangers within a geo-radius around you. This allows for more time & location relevant chats: say at a lecture hall, large library or public event. Messages are sent in realtime, and aren't saved to servers while you're chatting. Just like real conversations, we believe that the best socializing happens on the spot!

## Overview

This repository is public because we believe in the future of open source projects, the community is what makes developing so special ✨! It is split into the frontend `client` (app) and the backend `server`. Take a look around, we're sure you'll find yourself wanting to help out! Ready? Head here 👉 [contributing](#contributing)

## Installation

Unfortunately, as of Spring 2025, the app is still under development. However, we promise it will be out soon! 🙏

If you would like for us to release faster, join our team and head over to [contributing](#contributing)!

## Contributing

As an open source project, developers of all walks of life are encouraged to pick up issues and speed up the development of the app! However, it is probably a good idea to get yourself used to the app's structure!

If you want to set up the app for development follow the steps in the [documentation](https://osc-proximity-documentation.vercel.app/).

If you are interested in contributing to the UI/UX design of our app, please see our [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/2mvddKeA4XMODdCidYkDid/Proximity-Chat-App?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=V5A9MVRhlmdxGH0M-1).

## About Us
